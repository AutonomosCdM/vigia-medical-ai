## 🔧 Development Standards

### Medical Code Patterns
```python
# PHI-Compliant Medical Processing
from src.core.phi_tokenization_client import PHITokenizationClient
tokenizer = PHITokenizationClient()
batman_token = await tokenizer.create_token_async(hospital_mrn, patient_data)

# 9-Agent Medical Coordination
from src.agents.master_medical_orchestrator import MasterMedicalOrchestrator
orchestrator = MasterMedicalOrchestrator()
result = await orchestrator.process_medical_case_async(batman_token, image_path)

# Medical Guardrails (REQUIRED)
from src.ai.medical_guardrails import MedicalGuardrails
guardrails = MedicalGuardrails()
safety_result = await guardrails.validate_medical_response(llm_response, context)
```

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with medical scenarios
- **Medical Validation**: Clinical protocol compliance verification
